# PanzerStyles

This is just the contents of my .panzer folder for formatting documents with [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/index.html) and [Panzer](https://github.com/msprev/panzer).

The template LaTeX files are modified from the defaults included with Pandoc.

## Filters

- `small_caps.py`: Convert uppercase words to small caps.
- `example.py`: Creates custom example syntax, see the file for more details.
